# Feature Specification: Modern Podcast Website

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-am-building`  
**Created**: 2025-10-01  
**Status**: Draft  
**Constitution**: [Frontend Constitution](../../constitution.md)  
**Input**: User description: "I am building a mordern podcast website. I want it to look sleek, something would stand out. There should be a landing page, an episodes page, a FAQ page and an about page. Landing page would have one featured episodes. It should integrate with backend API to fetch featured episode and list all episodes."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a visitor, I want to quickly understand the podcast‚Äôs theme, play a highlighted episode, and browse the catalog so that I can decide what to listen to and learn more about the creators.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new visitor on the landing page, **When** they view the hero and featured episode, **Then** they see show title, description, and a single prominently featured episode with artwork and a play action.
2. **Given** a visitor on the episodes page, **When** they scroll the list, **Then** they can see 20 episodes (mocked), each with title, number, short description, duration, publish date, and artwork.
3. **Given** a visitor on the landing page, **When** they click ‚ÄúEpisodes‚Äù, **Then** they are taken to the episodes page.
4. **Given** a visitor on any page, **When** they open the navigation, **Then** they can access About and FAQ pages and return to Home.
5. **Given** a visitor on the About page, **When** they read the content, **Then** they see a concise description of the podcast and its hosts.
6. **Given** a visitor on the FAQ page, **When** they expand a question, **Then** they see a clear answer.
7. **Given** no external feeds are integrated, **When** the site loads, **Then** all episode data is sourced from bundled mock data without network dependency.
8. **Given** the featured episode is visible on the landing page, **When** the visitor activates the play action, **Then** audio playback begins using a bundled mock audio file.
9. **Given** a visitor is on the episodes page, **When** they select an episode item, **Then** its details expand inline and provide a control to play the same bundled mock audio.

### Edge Cases
- If JavaScript is disabled, primary content and navigation remain usable and the featured episode is still visible (play action may gracefully degrade to direct file link or no-op per static constraints).
- If images fail to load, alt text is provided and layout remains intact.
- If a visitor opens a malformed or non-existent episode link, the episodes page still displays the full list without errors.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a landing page that highlights the podcast brand and 1 featured episode from backend API.
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide an episodes page listing all episodes fetched from backend API.
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide an About page describing the podcast and creators.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a FAQ page with a list of common questions and answers.
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow navigation between Landing, Episodes, About, and FAQ from a consistent header/footer.
- **FR-006**: Each episode entry MUST include: title, episode number (or order), short description, duration, publish date, and artwork.
- **FR-007**: The featured episode MUST display prominently on the landing page with artwork, title, and a primary action to play or learn more.
- **FR-008**: The site MUST fetch episode data from backend API; fallback to embedded content only on API failure.
- **FR-009**: The presentation MUST be visually sleek and modern to "stand out" (distinctive typography, spacing, and artwork usage) while maintaining accessibility.
- **FR-010**: Pages MUST be accessible on mobile and desktop, with responsive layouts ensuring readable typography and tappable targets.
- **FR-011**: The site MUST provide built-in audio playback with audio files from backend API.
- **FR-012**: On the episodes page, selecting an episode MUST reveal additional details inline without navigating away.
- **FR-013**: System MUST show loading states while fetching data from backend API.
- **FR-014**: System MUST gracefully handle API failures with user-friendly error messages and fallback content.

### Decisions
- No separate episode detail pages in scope; details are shown inline on the episodes page.
- Audio playback is provided on-site using a bundled mock audio file reused across episodes.
- Branding uses a neutral, modern theme with a simple wordmark and a cohesive accent color palette.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Episode**: Represents a podcast episode. Attributes: id/number, title, description (short), duration, publish date, artwork URL/alt, optional audio URL, tags.
- **Page Content**: Represents static content for About and FAQ. Attributes: title, body (rich text), for FAQ: list of question/answer pairs.
