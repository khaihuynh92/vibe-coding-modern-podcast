# Implementation Plan: Modern Podcast Website

**Branch**: `001-i-am-building` | **Date**: 2025-10-01 | **Spec**: `/specs/001-i-am-building/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-i-am-building/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
Build a sleek, modern podcast site with four pages (Landing with one featured episode, Episodes list with all episodes, About, FAQ). Frontend integrates with backend API to dynamically fetch featured episode and list all episodes. Episode data is loaded from API by default, with embedded fallback content for resilience. Provide on-site audio playback with responsive and accessible UI.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Node.js (Active LTS)
**Primary Dependencies**: Fetch API for backend integration, optional lightweight tooling for build.  
**Storage**: N/A (no database); episode data fetched from backend API.  
**Testing**: HTML validation, link checking, Lighthouse CI, axe accessibility checks, API integration tests.  
**Target Platform**: Static hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages/Netlify/Vercel static export/Cloudflare Pages).  
**Project Type**: web (frontend + backend integration)  
**Performance Goals**: Mobile Lighthouse ≥ 90 across categories (guideline).  
**Constraints**: Static-first, progressive enhancement, CSP `default-src 'self'`, SRI for third-parties, no secrets in client.  
**Scale/Scope**: 4 pages; dynamic episode data from API; minimal JS with API integration.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Static-First: PASS — No runtime server; build outputs a self-contained `dist/`; API calls made at runtime.
- Progressive Enhancement: PASS — Content and navigation usable without JS; API calls enhance experience.
- Security & Privacy: PASS — HTTPS assumed; CSP `default-src 'self'`; no secrets; SRI for any third-party.
- Performance Budgets: PASS — API calls optimized; JavaScript < 50KB gzipped; CSS < 20KB gzipped.
- Additional Standards: PASS — SEO basics (`robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, meta); responsive images; asset minification and caching.
- Workflow & Quality Gates: PASS — PRs, CI for build + HTML/link checks + Lighthouse + axe + API tests; release on merge.

**Structure Decision**: Frontend application under `app/frontend/` with API integration to backend services. Build script produces static `dist/` directory for deployment.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. Extract unknowns from Technical Context above:
   - Backend API endpoints → research REST API patterns for episode data.
   - API integration patterns → research fetch API best practices for static sites.
   - Error handling → research graceful degradation for API failures.
2. Generate and dispatch research agents:
   - Best practices for API integration in static sites with progressive enhancement.
   - SEO essentials for dynamic content (Open Graph, Twitter cards, sitemap).
   - Error handling patterns for API failures in static sites.
3. Consolidate findings in `research.md`:
   - Decision: Fetch API with graceful degradation and fallback content.
   - Rationale: Meets Static-First with API enhancement; maintains accessibility.
   - Alternatives considered: Server-side rendering; rejected for static hosting constraints.

**Output**: research.md with all open decisions recorded (no blocking unknowns remain).

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
1. Extract entities from feature spec → `data-model.md`:
   - Episode, PageContent (FAQ Q/A).
   - API response schemas for episode endpoints.
   - Validation rules: required fields and formats.
2. Generate contracts from functional requirements:
   - JSON Schema for Episode and Page Content placed in `/contracts/`.
   - API contract definitions for backend integration.
3. Generate quickstart:
   - Commands to build and preview `dist/` with API integration.
4. Tests outline:
   - HTML validation, link check, axe checks, Lighthouse CI baseline.
   - API integration tests and error handling tests.
5. Update agent context:
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh cursor` (adds recent tech and decisions).

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 documents (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each entity → model validation task [P]
- Each page → template + content integration task [P]
- API integration → fetch implementation and error handling tasks
- Integration tests → validation/link/accessibility/API tests

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Define schemas and validation before building pages
- Dependency order: Content models → API integration → build script → pages → enhancements
- Mark [P] for parallel execution where independent

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 tasks in tasks.md
