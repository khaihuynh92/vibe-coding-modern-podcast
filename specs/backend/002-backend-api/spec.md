# Feature Specification: Backend API for Podcast Website

**Feature Branch**: `002-backend-api`  
**Created**: 2025-10-03  
**Status**: Draft  
**Constitution**: [Backend Constitution](../../constitution.md)  
**Input**: User description: "I am building the backend application that provide API for frontend of podcast website. There should be a landing page, an episodes page, a FAQ page and an about page. Landing page would have one featured episodes"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a frontend application, I want to consume REST APIs that provide episode data, static content, and health status so that I can build a modern podcast website with landing, episodes, about, and FAQ pages.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a frontend application needs episode data, **When** it calls the episodes API, **Then** it receives a list of all episodes with complete metadata including title, description, duration, publish date, artwork, and audio URLs.
2. **Given** a frontend application needs a featured episode for the landing page, **When** it calls the featured episode API, **Then** it receives the most recent episode with all required metadata.
3. **Given** a frontend application needs about page content, **When** it calls the about API, **Then** it receives structured content including mission, team information, and what the podcast covers.
4. **Given** a frontend application needs FAQ content, **When** it calls the FAQ API, **Then** it receives a list of questions and answers for the FAQ page.
5. **Given** a frontend application needs to check API health, **When** it calls the health endpoint, **Then** it receives system status and uptime information.
6. **Given** a frontend application needs to verify API readiness, **When** it calls the readiness endpoint, **Then** it receives dependency status and overall readiness.
7. **Given** the API receives a request for a non-existent episode, **When** it processes the request, **Then** it returns a 404 error with appropriate error message.
8. **Given** the API experiences an internal error, **When** it processes any request, **Then** it returns a 500 error with appropriate error message and logs the issue.
9. **Given** a frontend application makes a request with invalid parameters, **When** the API validates the request, **Then** it returns a 400 error with validation details.

### Edge Cases
- If the episodes data file is missing or corrupted, the API should return default episode data.
- If the about content file is missing, the API should return default about content.
- If the FAQ content file is missing, the API should return default FAQ content.
- If the API is under heavy load, it should maintain response times under 200ms for 95th percentile.
- If external dependencies are unavailable, the readiness check should reflect the actual status.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a REST API endpoint that returns all episodes with complete metadata.
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a REST API endpoint that returns the featured episode (most recent).
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a REST API endpoint that returns about page content in structured format.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a REST API endpoint that returns FAQ content as question/answer pairs.
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide health check endpoints for monitoring and load balancer health checks.
- **FR-006**: System MUST return episodes sorted by episode number in descending order (newest first).
- **FR-007**: System MUST include episode metadata: ID, number, title, description, duration, publish date, artwork URL, artwork alt text, audio URL, and tags.
- **FR-008**: System MUST return consistent JSON response format across all endpoints.
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle missing or corrupted content files by providing default content.
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate episode ID parameters and return appropriate errors for invalid IDs.
- **FR-011**: System MUST support CORS for frontend integration.
- **FR-012**: System MUST include proper HTTP status codes for all responses.
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide API documentation accessible via Swagger UI.
- **FR-014**: System MUST log all API requests and errors for monitoring and debugging.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: API response times MUST be under 200ms for 95th percentile of requests.
- **NFR-002**: System MUST support horizontal scaling through stateless design.
- **NFR-003**: System MUST implement proper security headers and CORS configuration.
- **NFR-004**: System MUST provide structured logging for production monitoring.
- **NFR-005**: System MUST handle graceful shutdown with proper request completion.
- **NFR-006**: System MUST be containerized for consistent deployment across environments.

### Decisions
- Episodes are identified by both string ID (e.g., "ep001") and numeric ID (e.g., "1").
- Featured episode is determined by the highest episode number.
- Content is loaded from frontend content files with fallback to default content.
- API follows RESTful conventions with JSON responses.
- Health checks are separate from readiness checks for proper Kubernetes integration.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Episode**: Represents a podcast episode. Attributes: id, number, title, description, duration, publishDate, artworkUrl, artworkAlt, audioUrl, tags.
- **AboutContent**: Represents about page content. Attributes: title, description, mission, whoWeAre, whatWeCover, joinCommunity.
- **FAQItem**: Represents a single FAQ item. Attributes: question, answer.
- **HealthResponse**: Represents health check response. Attributes: status, timestamp, version, uptime, system.
- **ErrorResponse**: Represents error response. Attributes: error, message, code.
